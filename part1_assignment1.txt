The following is what I've learned:
No 1:a person will offer all his passion to his interest and he can even quit his job for what he want to do.
No 2:In America,weapons like guns and tanks are use freely,which result in chaotic somehow.
No 3:African men are Hollywood stereotypes as roles of gunmen.
No 4:In country like India,patriarchy continued to rule the lives of most women,which leads to feminist movement.
	Finally,I think that women in India will obtain their rights and freedom sooner or later.Like a piece of news a few days ago,Indian women gather together trying to keep clean around their houses.
